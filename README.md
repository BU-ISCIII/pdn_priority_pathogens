# ðŸ¦  PDN Priority Pathogens List

This repository is part of the [PDN (Pathogen Data Network)](https://pathogendatanetwork.org/) initiative and contains a curated, updatable list of priority pathogens. The aim is to centralize information from various international organizations and establish a harmonized and structured reference list for research and public health decision-making.

## Objectives

- Aggregate pathogen prioritization lists from leading public health and research organizations.
- Provide a unified reference with consistent taxonomy and annotation.
- Support pathogen surveillance, pandemic preparedness, and biosecurity efforts.
- Make prioritization data machine-readable, as many official lists are only available in formats (PDFs or websites) that are not readily accessible for automated analysis.

## Methodology

### Taxonomic standardization

- Pathogens are named using scientific species names whenever possible.
- When species-level resolution is not feasible, the genus name is used.
- Viral naming follows ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) recommendations.
- Additional or common names are listed under the `also_known_as` field.

### Data sources

The prioritization list integrates information from international and national agencies, using their publicly available priority lists. Each source is referenced below:

## Priority Type Classification

Each pathogen is categorized into one or more "priority types", based on its inclusion in the above lists. These allow grouping pathogens by relevance across thematic areas.

Unique priority types used:

```
- Pandemic preparedness
- Biodefense/Bioterrorism
- vaccine-preventable
- STI
- AMR/Nosocomial infection
- Animal disease
- Neglected Tropical Diseases
- Other
```

> Pathogens may belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

### Prioritization logic

#### Inclusion criteria

- Included if the pathogen appears in at least --two of the following global health agency lists--: WHO, NIAID, ECDC.

  - Note: Fungal pathogens are only prioritized by WHO and NIAID and are not present in ECDC or Africa CDC lists.
- Additionally, the pathogen must be listed under at least --two distinct priority categories--, excluding "Animal disease".

#### Score and ranking

Each pathogen is assigned a composite --priority score--, calculated based on:

- Number of appearances in key organizational lists (WHO, NIAID, ECDC) Ã—1
- Number of appearances in broader organizational sets (WHO, NIAID, ECDC, AFRICACDC) Ã—2
- Number of different priority types (excluding "Animal disease") Ã—1
- Whether the pathogen has been detected in wastewater monitoring Ã—1
- Additional adjustment for underepresentation:

  - Fungi: +3
  - Protozoan parasites: +4

This score is stored in the field `priority_score`.

The full ranked list is available in `complete_priority_pathogens.json`, including the computed priority score and the derived `priority_order`.

#### Final selection

- A total of --50 pathogens-- from --33 families-- were retained after filtering.
- From this list, a subset of --22 pathogens-- is selected for PDN priority consideration, based on the inclusion criteria.
- Pathogens with a --priority score â‰¥ 12-- are marked with `highest_priority: true`.

## Outputs

- `complete_priority_pathogens.csv`: Raw data table from the Google Sheet.
- `complete_priority_pathogens.json`: Full list with all processed entries and scores.
- `pdn_priority_pathogens.json`: Subset of 50 priority pathogens, filtered by inclusion criteria.

Each pathogen entry includes:

- `priority_type` (as list)
- `prioritized_by` (list of sources)
- `priority_score`
- `priority_order`
- `highest_priority` (boolean)

## Updating

Run the script `generate_pathogens_list.py` to pull the latest data and regenerate all outputs.

### Example usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python generate_pathogens_list.py
```

This will generate the updated `.csv` and `.json` files based on the current Google Sheet data.
