# ðŸ¦  PDN Priority Pathogens List

This repository is part of the [PDN (Pathogen Data Network)](https://pathogendatanetwork.org/) initiative and contains a curated, updatable list of priority pathogens. The aim is to centralize information from various international organizations and establish a harmonized and structured reference list for research and public health decision-making.

## Objectives

- Aggregate pathogen prioritization lists from leading public health and research organizations.
- Provide a unified reference with consistent taxonomy and annotation.
- Support pathogen surveillance, pandemic preparedness, and biosecurity efforts.
- Make prioritization data machine-readable, as many official lists are only available in formats (PDFs or websites) that are not readily accessible for automated analysis.

## Methodology

### Taxonomic standardization

- Pathogens are named using scientific species names whenever possible.
- When species-level resolution is not feasible, the genus name is used.
- Viral naming follows ICTV (International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses) recommendations.
- Additional or common names are listed under the `Also known as` field.

### Data sources

The prioritization list integrates information from international and national agencies, using their publicly available priority lists. Each source is referenced below:

## Priority Type Classification

Each pathogen is categorized into one or more "priority types", based on its inclusion in the above lists. These allow grouping pathogens by relevance across thematic areas.

**Unique priority types used:**

```text
- Pandemic preparedness
- Biodefense/Bioterrorism
- vaccine-preventable
- STI
- AMR/Nosocomial infection
- Animal disease
- Neglected Tropical Diseases
- Other
```

> Pathogens may belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

### Prioritization logic

#### Score and ranking

Each pathogen is assigned a composite priority score, calculated based on:

- Number of appearances in key organizational lists (Ã—1)
- Number of different priority types associated with the pathogen (Ã—2)
- Whether the pathogen has been detected in wastewater monitoring systems (Ã—1)
- Additional points are added to fungal pathogens (+3) and protozoan parasites (+4) to adjust for underrepresentation.

The complete scored list is available in complete\_priority\_pathogens.json, where pathogens are ordered by descending priority score.

#### Inclusion criteria

- Included if the pathogen appears in at least **two of the following global health agency lists**: WHO, NIAID, ECDC.
  - Note: Fungal pathogens are only prioritized by WHO and NIAID and are not present in ECDC or Africa CDC lists.
- Additionally, the pathogen must be listed under at least **two distinct priority types** (e.g., Pandemic preparedness and Biodefense/Bioterrorism).

#### PDN final selection

The final selection in file `pdn_priority_list.json` is derived from the full list using the inclusion criteria described above.

- A total of **50 pathogens** from **33 families** were retained after filtering.
- A subset of **26 pathogens** is selected for PDN priority consideration with a **priority score â‰¥ 12** are marked as "highest priority" to ensure balanced representation across pathogen types: bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa.

## Outputs

- `patogenos_prioritarios.csv`: Tabular data extracted from the source.
- `patogenos_prioritarios.json`: Structured version with:

  - Harmonized taxonomy and metadata
  - `Priority type` and `prioritized_by`
  - Appearance counters and taxonomy ID

## Updating

Run the script `generate_pathogens_list.py` to pull the latest data and regenerate the files from the live Google Sheet.

### Example usage

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python generate_pathogens_list.py
```

This will generate updated `.csv` and `.json` files based on the latest content in the linked Google Sheet.
